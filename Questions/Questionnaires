TRUE OR FALSE 10pts.
User requirements are typically stated in natural language.
TRUE
Software is abstracted and intangible.
TRUE
Based on the transformation of a mathematical specification through different representations to an executable program.
TRUE
Transformations are ‘Cleanroom’ so it is straightforward to show that the program conforms to its specification.
FALSE
Based on the idea of manufacturing semi-conductors in a “cleanroom environment”.
TRUE
Communication focuses on unit tests (written before the code is made) and running periodic integration tests; functional tests are conducted based on the “user stories”; programmers and customers get concrete feedback.
FALSE
Feedback favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.
FALSE
Courage code for today and not tomorrow; refactoring; persistence; knowing when to throw code away.
TRUE
Black Box shows data implementation but hides process implementation; describes how "state" information is transformed.
FALSE
Clear Box hides data implementation and process implementation. It describes how a system responds to stimuli, usually in a formal specification language.
FALSE

TRUE OR FALSE 10pts.
If in some instances that we will have with us the availability of an analytical solution then we will have the capability to compute the error approximately.
False
A function typically changes sign in the vicinity of a root.
True
An exception to the general case is that when the function is tangential to the x axis and the end points are of opposite signs, there are an even number of axis intersections for the interval.
True
Graphical techniques are of limited practical value because they are not precise but they can be utilized to obtain rough estimates of roots.
True
Given an upper bound and a lower bound, when a function changes sign in an interval, then there will generally be an even number of roots.
False
In the bisection algorithm, to determine the subinterval in the next iteration, the following conditional statement is legitimate: If f(xuf(xr) is negative, the root lies in the lower subinterval.
False
The secant method use the derivative instead of a difference to estimate the slope.

Muller’s method uses the idea of projecting a line through two points on the x-axis to estimate the root.
