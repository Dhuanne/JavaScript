SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
IDENTIFICATION 10pts.
It is a concrete model of how a system will appear or behave, and usually depict the user interface?
Prototype
It is a non-functional user interface layout that uses actual GUI components and validates UI design?
Mockup
It iss main goal is to build a very robust prototype in a structured manner and constantly refine it?
Evolutionary prototyping
It is the process of applying various techniques and principles for the purpose of defining a device, process or system in sufficient detail to permit its physical realization?
Design
It refers to the iterative process through which requirements are translated into a “blueprint” for building software?
Software Design
It establishes a basic structural framework that identifies the major components of a system and the communication among these components?
Architectural Design
It leads to the accurate specification of requirements, and the construction of a valid and useable system from the users’ perspective via conventional software development models?
Throwaway prototyping
It consists of a central data store and a set of independent components that access the data store?
Repository
This Architectural Style’s system is organized as a set of services and associated servers and clients that access and use these services?

TRUE OR FALSE 10pts.
User requirements are typically stated in natural language.
TRUE
Software is abstracted and intangible.
TRUE
Based on the transformation of a mathematical specification through different representations to an executable program.
TRUE
Transformations are ‘Cleanroom’ so it is straightforward to show that the program conforms to its specification.
FALSE
Based on the idea of manufacturing semi-conductors in a “cleanroom environment”.
TRUE
Communication focuses on unit tests (written before the code is made) and running periodic integration tests; functional tests are conducted based on the “user stories”; programmers and customers get concrete feedback.
FALSE
Feedback favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.
FALSE
Courage code for today and not tomorrow; refactoring; persistence; knowing when to throw code away.
TRUE
Black Box shows data implementation but hides process implementation; describes how "state" information is transformed.
FALSE
Clear Box hides data implementation and process implementation. It describes how a system responds to stimuli, usually in a formal specification language.
FALSE

NUMERICAL METHODS

IDENTIFICATION 10pts.
These are techniques by which mathematical problems are formulated so that they can be solved with arithmetic operations.
Numerical methods
It refers to how closely a computed or measured value agrees with the true value.
Accuracy
It is a type of incremental search method in which the interval is always divided in half.
Bolzano’s method
This is the discrepancy introduced by the fact that numerical methods may employ approximations to represent exact mathematical operations and quantities.
Transaction error
A kind of error that is not directly connected with numerical methods.
Formulation error
When computer programs are divided into small subprograms which can be developed and tested separately then we are doing an approach called.
Modular programming
This software is produced by Microsoft, Inc. that allows the user to enter and perform calculations on rows and columns of data.
Excel
It refers to how closely individuals computed or measured agree with each other.
Precision
It refers to the systematic deviation from the truth.
Inaccuracy
It refers to the magnitude of the scatter of the approximate values.
Imprecision

TRUE OR FALSE 10pts.
If in some instances that we will have with us the availability of an analytical solution then we will have the capability to compute the error approximately.
False
A function typically changes sign in the vicinity of a root.
True
An exception to the general case is that when the function is tangential to the x axis and the end points are of opposite signs, there are an even number of axis intersections for the interval.
True
Graphical techniques are of limited practical value because they are not precise but they can be utilized to obtain rough estimates of roots.
True
Given an upper bound and a lower bound, when a function changes sign in an interval, then there will generally be an even number of roots.
False
In the bisection algorithm, to determine the subinterval in the next iteration, the following conditional statement is legitimate: If f(xuf(xr) is negative, the root lies in the lower subinterval.
False
The secant method use the derivative instead of a difference to estimate the slope.
False
Muller’s method uses the idea of projecting a line through two points on the x-axis to estimate the root.
False
Bairstow’s method is generally based on the mathematical process of dividing a polynomial by a quadratic factor.
True
The bisection method, which is alternatively called binary chopping, interval halving, or Bolzano’s method, is one type of incremental search method in which the interval is always divided in half.
True
